# Advent of Code 2019 - Day 3: Crossed Wires

This project provides a solution for Advent of Code 2019, Day 3, focusing on visualizing wire paths and finding intersections.

## Features

-   **Wire Path Calculation:** Logic to parse wire movement instructions and generate their paths on a 2D grid.
-   **Intersection Detection:** Algorithms to find points where two wire paths cross.
-   **PNG Generator:** A command-line tool to generate high-quality PNG images of wire path visualizations.

## PNG Generator Tool

The `png-generator` tool allows you to create static image representations of wire paths.

### Usage

To generate a PNG image, navigate to the project's root directory and run the `png-generator` with various input options:

#### 1. Using Built-in Test Data

```bash
go run wires/cmd/png-generator/main.go -test -out test_data_continuous.png
```

#### 2. Providing Paths Directly

```bash
go run wires/cmd/png-generator/main.go -path1 "R8,U5,L5,D3" -path2 "U7,R6,D4,L4" -out small_path.png
```

#### 3. From Input Files

First, ensure you have your wire paths in separate files (e.g., `wire1.txt`, `wire2.txt`). You can create them from the provided `input` file:

```bash
head -n 1 input > wire1.txt
tail -n 1 input > wire2.txt
```

Then, run the generator:

```bash
go run wires/cmd/png-generator/main.go -file1 wire1.txt -file2 wire2.txt -out from_file.png
```

### Generated Examples

Here are some examples of the wire path visualizations generated by the tool:

## Project Structure

-   `wires/`: Contains the core logic for wire path manipulation and rendering.
    -   `wires.go`: Core functions for reading paths, generating paths, and finding intersections.
    -   `geometry/geometry.go`: Defines `Point` and `Bounds` structs, along with geometric calculations like `WorldToScreen` and `AutoScaleAndCenter`.
    -   `renderer.go`: Handles the drawing of wire paths, intersections, and the background onto an `image.RGBA`.
    -   `colors.go`: Defines color schemes for the visualization.
-   `wires/cmd/png-generator/`: Contains the `main.go` for the command-line PNG generation tool.
-   `input`: The original input file for the Advent of Code challenge.
